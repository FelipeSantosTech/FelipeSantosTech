## Hi, I’m Felipe 👋

18-year-old builder from Brazil focused on mobile app development.

I’m learning by building real projects and shipping consistently.

Currently working on two mobile apps: 
1 - HABITSS -> Habit tracker that blocks social media till you complete your daily habits
2 - PEDRO -> Movie buddy that lets you rank the movies you've watched and gives you personalized recommendations
